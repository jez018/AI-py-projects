## Data Visualization Work to help us understand the data before we build the model.

1. check genders missing values:
	a. if its at a significant(i.e little) amount del it.
	b. it has to be.

2. compare genders with relevant experience (bar chart)
3. compare genders with training hours (scatter plot) 
4. comapre genders with experience (scatter plot)
5. compare genders with last_new_job (scatter plot, bar chart)
6. compare relevant experience with education level (bar chart)
7. use gender, relevant_experience, enrolled uni, edu level, major_disc and experience, in a separate model to predict company_type
8. if missing values of company type has been filled use info to fill in company size missing values.
9. compare education level against company size (histogram or bar chart and pie chart)
10. compare major discipline with training hours (line graph and scatter plot)
11. compare city_dev_index with training hours (scatter or line)
12. commpare city_dev_index with relevant experience and education level (scatter plot)
13. compare city_dev_index with last_new_job
